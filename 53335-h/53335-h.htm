  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The name of Robert Browning has been before the world
now for fifty years. For the greater part of the time his work
has had so little recognition, that one marvels at his courage in
going so steadily on with it. His “Pomegranates” have been
produced year after year, decade after decade, in unfailing
abundance; and, while critics have kept paring at the rind, and
the general public has not even asked if there was anything
beneath it, he has laboured on with unremitting energy, calmly
awaiting the time when “the heart within, blood-tinctured, of a
veined humanity,” should be at length discovered. It can scarcely
be said, even yet, that that time has come; but it is coming fast.
Already he is something more than “the poet’s poet.” Few
intelligent people now are content to know one of the master
minds of the age simply as the author of “The Pied Piper of
Hamelin,” as if that were the only thing he had written worth
reading!</p>

<p class='c007'>That the form in which the thought of Browning is cast is
altogether admirable, is what none but his most undiscriminating
admirers will assert. It is often, unquestionably, rough and
forbidding. But there is strength even in its ruggedness; and
in its entire freedom from conventionality there is a charm such
as one enjoys in wild mountain scenery, even though only in
little patches it may have any suggestion of the garden or the
lawn. There are those who have charged the poet with affectation
of the uncouth and the bizarre; but careful reading will, we
think, render it apparent that it is rather his utter freedom from
affectation which determines and perpetuates the peculiarities
and oddities of his style; that, in fact, the aphorism of Buffon, “<i>le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>style est l’homme même</i>,” is undoubtedly true as applied to him.
It would, of course, be absurd to claim for the pomegranate the
bloom and beauty of the peach; but, equally with the other, it
is Nature’s gift, and to toss aside a rough-rinded fruit because it
needs to be “cut deep down the middle” before its pulp and
juices can be reached, is surely far from wise. Even hard nuts
are not to be despised, if the kernels are good; and as to
Browning’s “nuts,” we have this to say, that not only are they
well worth cracking, but there is in the process excellent
exercise for the teeth.</p>

<p class='c007'>This brings us to the alleged “obscurity” of Browning’s
writings, which still continues to be the main obstacle to their
general appreciation. It is freely admitted that often it is not quite
easy, and sometimes very difficult, to understand him; and it is
hard for most people to see why he could not make his meaning
plainer, and matter for regret to many, who heartily admire him,
that he has not done so. That he has taken some pains to this
end is evident from what he says in the preface to “Sordello,”
written for an edition issued in 1863, twenty-three years after its
original publication: “My own faults of expression were
many.... I blame nobody, least of all myself, who did my
best then and since, for I lately gave time and pains to turn my
work into what the many might—instead of what the few must—like.”
In a later preface (1872) he says, “Nor do I apprehend
any more charges of being wilfully obscure, unconscientiously
careless, or perversely harsh.” The true explanation of it seems
to be what we have already suggested, that he does not think of
his audience as he writes, his only care being to express the
thought in the way which comes most natural to him. As a
dramatist, he can throw himself with abandonment into the
persons he represents; but he never seems to think of putting
himself in the position of a listener, or, if he does, he assumes
too readily that he has a mind of similar texture and grasp to
his own. On the other hand, it is fair to say that the difficulty
of understanding him arises in great part from the very excellence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span>of his work. The following considerations will illustrate
what we mean:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. His work is full of <i>thought</i>, and the thought is never
commonplace. There is so much of it, and all is so fresh,
and therefore unfamiliar, that some mental effort is necessary
to grasp it. The following characteristic remark of Bishop
Butler, in his preface to the famous Fifteen Sermons, is
worth consideration in this connection: “It must be acknowledged
that some of the following Discourses are very
abstruse and difficult; or, if you please, obscure; but I must
take leave to add that those alone are judges, whether or no
and how far this is a fault, who are judges, whether or no
and how far it might have been avoided—those only who will be
at the trouble to understand what is here said, and to see how
far the things here insisted upon, and not other things, might
have been put in a plainer manner; which yet I am very far
from asserting that they could not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The expression is always the briefest. Not only are no
words wasted, but, where connecting ideas are easily supplied,
they are often left unexpressed, the intelligence and mental
activity of the reader being always taken for granted.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The poems are, for the most part, dramatic in principle.
The reader is brought face to face with some soul, in its
thoughts and emotions, frequently in the very process of the
thinking and the feeling. The poet has stepped aside, and of
course supplies no key. The author does not appear, like the
chorus in a Greek play, to point a moral or explain the situation.
The <i>dramatis personæ</i> must explain themselves. And, just as
Shakespeare must be <i>studied</i> in order to an appreciation other
than second-hand, so must Browning be studied in order to be
appreciated at all; for his writings are not yet old enough to
secure much second-hand enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The wealth of allusion is another source of difficulty. The
learning of our poet is encyclopædic; and though there is no
display of it, there is large use of it; and it often happens that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>passages or phrases, which seem crabbed or obscure, require
only the knowledge of some unfamiliar fact in science or in
history, or it may be something not readily thought of, and yet
within easy range of a keen enough observation, to light them
up and reveal unsuspected strength or beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before leaving the subject of the rough and often tough
exterior of Browning’s work, it may be interesting to refer to
the characteristic illustration of it he has lately given us in
the prologue to “Ferishtah’s Fancies,” his most recent work.
He begins by asking the reader whether he has ever “eaten
ortolans in Italy,” and then goes on to describe the preparation
of them. The following lines will show the use he makes of
the illustration:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“First comes plain bread, crisp, brown, a toasted square;</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Then, a strong sage-leaf;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>(So we find books with flowers dried here and there</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Lest leaf engage leaf.)</div>
      <div class='line in1'>First, food—then, piquancy—and last of all</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Follows the thirdling;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Through wholesome hard, sharp soft, your tooth must bite</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Ere reach the birdling.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Now, were there only crust to crunch, you’d wince:</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Unpalatable!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sage-leaf is bitter-pungent—so’s a quince;</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Eat each who’s able!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But through all three bite boldly—lo, the gust!</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Flavour—no fixture—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Flies permeating flesh and leaf and crust</div>
      <div class='line in5'>In fine admixture.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So with your meal, my poem; masticate</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Sense, sight and song there!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Digest these, and I praise your peptics’ state,</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Nothing found wrong there.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This extract also furnishes an example of the strange rhymes
in which the poet sometimes indulges, with what appears too
little refinement of taste.</p>

<p class='c007'>The themes of Browning’s poetry are the very greatest that
can engage the thought of man. He ranges over a vast variety
of topic; but, wherever his thought may lead him, he never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>loses sight of that which is to him the centre of all, the human
soul, with its infinite wants and capabilities. In the preface to
“Sordello” he says: “The historical decoration was purposely
of no more importance than a background requires; and my
stress lay on the incidents in the development of a soul: little
else is worth study. I, at least, always thought so.” To this
principle he has kept true through all his work; and hence it is
that, whether the particular subject be love, or home, or
country; poetry, painting, or music; life, death, or immortality;
it is dealt with in its relation to “the development of a soul.”
Hence it is that his poetry is so thoroughly and profoundly
spiritual, and so exceedingly valuable as a counteractive to the
materialism of the age, which ever tends to merge the soul in
the body, and swallow up the real in mere phenomena.</p>

<p class='c007'>As might be expected of one who deals so profoundly with all
that he touches, the great reality of the universe to him is God.
Agnosticism has little mercy at his hands; if a man knows
anything at all, he knows God. And the God whom he knows
is not a God apart, looking down from some infinite or indefinite
height upon the world, but one in whom all live and move and
have their being. Out of this springs, of course, the hope of
immortality, and also that bright and cheerful view of life so
completely opposed to the dark pessimism to which much of the
unbelieving speculation of the present day so painfully tends.
The dark things of human life and destiny are by no means
ignored; rather are they dwelt on with a painful and sometimes
frightful realism; but even amid deepest darkness the light
above is never quite extinguished, and some little “Pippa
passes” singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The year’s at the spring</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And day’s at the morn;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Morning’s at seven;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The hill-side’s dew-pearled;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The lark’s on the wing;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The snail’s on the thorn:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>God’s in his heaven—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>All’s right with the world.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>There has been much discussion as to Browning’s personal
attitude to Christianity. The profoundly Christian tone of his
writings is, of course, universally acknowledged; but attempts
are sometimes made to evade the force of those numerous
passages in which he speaks of the Incarnation, and Death,
and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus, in a way which seems
to imply his hearty acceptance of the substance of what is
known as evangelical truth. Much has been made in this
connection of the way in which, in one of his prefaces, he
characterises his work as “poetry always dramatic in principle,
and so many utterances of so many imaginary persons, not
mine;” and it has been asserted that it is as unwarrantable to
consider him to be speaking his own sentiments in a poem like
“Christmas Eve,” as in one like “Johannes Agricola,” or
“Bishop Blougram’s Apology.” The obvious answer is that
this profound sympathy with the Christ of God and His
salvation is not found in some solitary production, but appears
and reappears, often when least expected, all through his works.
In that remarkable little poem, entitled “House,” in which
more strongly than anywhere else he claims personal privacy,
while he declines to be regarded as having furnished his
publishers with tickets to view his own soul’s dwelling, he
admits that “whoso desires to penetrate deeper” may do so
“by the spirit sense;” and accordingly some of his admirers,
who dissent from him most strongly on this point, are the most
ready to acknowledge that his Christian faith is no stage suit,
but the very garment of his soul. As illustration of this we
may refer to the admirable essay by the late James Thomson,
published in Part II. of the Browning Society’s Papers, in
which, after expressing his amazement that a great mind like
Browning’s could be Christian, he asserts the, to him, remarkable
but quite undeniable fact in these words: “The devout and
hopeful Christian faith, explicitly or implicitly affirmed in such
poems as <i>Saul</i>, <i>Kharshish</i>, <i>Cleon</i>, <i>Caliban upon Setebos</i>, <i>A
Death in the Desert</i>, <i>Instans Tyrannus</i>, <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span><i>Prospice</i>, the <i>Epilogue</i>, and throughout that stupendous monumental
work, <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, must surely be as clear as
noonday to even the most purblind vision.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That a great Christian poet, in an age when so many of the
intellectual magnates of the time are hostile or simply silent,
should remain unknown or little known to any large proportion
of Christian readers, is certainly very much to be regretted.
Surely the admiration which is freely and generously accorded
to his work by many who are constrained to it in spite of his
faith in a Christ whom they reject, is a rebuke to the indifference
of those who, sharing his faith, do not give themselves the
trouble to inquire what he has to say about it. There are not
so many avowed and outspoken Christians in the highest walks
of literature that we can afford to pay only slight attention to
the utterances of one who has the ear of the deepest thinkers in
every school of thought all the world over.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>The immediate object of this selection is to supply an introduction
to the study of Browning for the benefit of the readers
of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle; but it is
hoped that many others, inspired with similar aims, and who
have not had such advantages that they can dispense with all
assistance in the study of a difficult author, may find help from
this little book. It is, of course, better to read for one’s self than
to follow the guidance of another; and yet it may be necessary
to open a path far enough to lead within sight of the treasures in
store. This is all that has been attempted here—only the indication
of a few veins near the surface of a rich mine, which the
reader is strongly recommended to explore for himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The selection has been arranged on the principle of beginning
with that which is simple, and proceeding gradually to the more
complex, with some regard also to variety and progress in subjects,
and at the same time to appropriateness for the use of those
younger readers for whom this selection mainly is intended.</p>

<p class='c007'>The notes are meant to serve only as a guide to beginners;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>and as guides are proverbially an annoyance when their services
are imposed unsought, these are disposed at the end of each
poem, and without reference marks to mar the pages, so that
the selection may be read, if desired, without any interference
from the notes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within the limits of a volume like this, only the shorter poems
could find a place. Most valuable extracts from the longer
works might have been given; but this is always a questionable
method of dealing with the best writers, with those especially
whose thought is strictly consecutive, while the effect of particular
passages depends to a large extent on their setting and
their relation to the work as a whole. The only<a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c009'><sup>[A]</sup></a> exception to
this is the treatment of “Christmas Eve and Easter Day,” with
extracts from which this volume closes. That remarkable work
occupies a middle position between the shorter and the longer
poems of our author; and, though too long for insertion entire,
is yet so important, that it seemed very desirable to give some
idea of it. In furnishing a series of extracts from this work, an
attempt has been made to reduce the disadvantage above
referred to by supplying along with them a slight sketch or
“argument,” so as to give some idea, to those unacquainted with
it, of the course of thought throughout.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is right to say that Mr. Browning has given his kind
permission for the publication in the United States of this
Selection, and also of the Notes, for which, however, as for the
selection itself, he is in no wise responsible.</p>

      <div class='line'>And whoever wakes in England sees, some morning, unaware,</div>
      <div class='line'>That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf</div>
      <div class='line'>Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf,</div>
      <div class='line'>While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough</div>

      <div class='line'>Blossoms and dewdrops—at the bent spray’s edge—</div>
      <div class='line'>That’s the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over</div>
      <div class='line'>Lest you should think he never could recapture</div>
      <div class='line'>The first fine careless rapture!</div>
      <div class='line'>And, though the fields look rough with hoary dew,</div>
      <div class='line'>All will be gay when noontide wakes anew</div>

      <div class='line'>Bluish ’mid the burning water, full in face Trafalgar lay;</div>

<p class='c007'>The former of these companion poems may have been written from Italy
or the south of Spain, as would appear from the last line of it. Mr. E. C.
Stedman, one of the severest of Browning’s appreciative critics, commenting
(in his “Victorian Poets”) on the lines beginning “That’s the wise thrush,”
says:—“Having in mind Shakespeare and Shelley, I nevertheless think
these three lines the finest ever written touching the song of a bird.”</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>In the latter poem, the course is from the southern point of Portugal
through the Straits. “Here and here”—the reference is to the battles of
Cape St. Vincent (1796) and Trafalgar (1805), and perhaps to the defence
of Gibraltar (1782).</p>

      <div class='line'>Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The indefiniteness of the date at the head of this poem will be best
explained by the following extract from a letter of Mr. Browning’s, published
in 1881 in the <i>Boston Literary World</i>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no sort of historical foundation about ‘Good News From
Ghent.’ I wrote it under the bulwark of a vessel off the African coast,
after I had been at sea long enough to appreciate even the fancy of a gallop
on the back of a certain good horse ‘York,’ then in my stable at home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This poem, therefore, widely known and appreciated as one of the most
stirring in the language, may be regarded as a living picture to illustrate
the pages—no page in particular—of Motley.</p>

<p class='c007'>As parallels in American literature, reference may be made to “Paul
Revere’s Ride,” by Longfellow, and “Sheridan’s Ride,” by T. B. Reade.</p>

      <div class='line'>Here is a story, shall stir you! Stand up, Greeks dead and gone,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who breasted, beat Barbarians, stemmed Persia rolling on,</div>

      <div class='line'>In his tribe and file: up, back, out, down—was the spear-arm play:</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But one man kept no rank, and his sole arm plied no spear,</div>
      <div class='line'>As a flashing came and went, and a form i’ the van, the rear,</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Nor helmed nor shielded, he! but, a goat-skin all his wear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a tiller of the soil, with a clown’s limbs broad and bare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Went he ploughing on and on: he pushed with a ploughman’s share.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Did the weak mid-line give way, as tunnies on whom the shark</div>
      <div class='line'>Precipitates his bulk? Did the right-wing halt when, stark</div>
      <div class='line'>On his heap of slain, lay stretched Kallimachos Polemarch?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Did the steady phalanx falter? To the rescue, at the need,</div>
      <div class='line'>The clown was ploughing Persia, clearing Greek earth of weed,</div>
      <div class='line'>As he routed through the Sakian and rooted up the Mede.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>But the deed done, battle won,—nowhere to be descried</div>
      <div class='line'>On the meadow, by the stream, at the marsh,—look far and wide</div>
      <div class='line'>From the foot of the mountain, no, to the last blood-plashed sea-side,—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Not anywhere on view blazed the large limbs thonged and brown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shearing and clearing still with the share before which—down</div>
      <div class='line'>To the dust went Persia’s pomp, as he ploughed for Greece, that clown!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How spake the Oracle? “Care for no name at all!</div>
      <div class='line'>Say but just this: We praise one helpful whom we call</div>
      <div class='line'>The Holder of the Ploughshare. The great deed ne’er grows small.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Not the great name! Sing—woe for the great name Míltiadés,</div>
      <div class='line'>And its end at Paros isle! Woe for Themistokles—</div>
      <div class='line'>Satrap in Sardis court! Name not the clown like these!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The name, Echetlos, is derived from ἐχέτλη, a plough handle. It is not
strictly a proper name, but an appellative, meaning “the Holder of the
Ploughshare.” The story is found in Pausanias, author of the “Itinerary
of Greece” (1, 15, 32). Nothing further is necessary in order to understand
this little poem and appreciate its rugged strength than familiarity with the
battle of Marathon, and some knowledge of Miltiades and Themistocles,
the one known as the hero of Marathon, and the other as the hero of
Salamis. The lesson of the poem (“The great <i>deed</i> ne’er grows small, not
the great <i>name</i>!”) is taught in a way not likely to be forgotten. One is
reminded of another, who wished to be nameless, heard only as “the voice
of one crying in the wilderness!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The ellipsis in thought between the eighth and ninth stanzas is so easily
supplied that it is noticed here only as a simple illustration of what is sometimes
the occasion of difficulty (see Introduction, p. iii). It would only have
lengthened the poem and weakened it to have inserted a stanza telling in so
many words that when the hero could not be found, a message was sent to

      <div class='line'>Who hears of Helen’s Tower, may dream perchance,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>How the Greek Beauty from the Scæan Gate</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Gazed on old friends unanimous in hate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Death-doom’d because of her fair countenance.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Hearts would leap otherwise, at thy advance,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Lady, to whom this Tower is consecrate:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Like hers, thy face once made all eyes elate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet, unlike hers, was bless’d by every glance.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Tower of Hate is outworn, far and strange:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>A transitory shame of long ago,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>It dies into the sand from which it sprang:</div>
      <div class='line'>But thine, Love’s rock-built Tower, shall fear no change:</div>
      <div class='line in4'>God’s self laid stable Earth’s foundations so,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>When all the morning-stars together sang.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The tower is one built by Lord Dufferin, in memory of his mother Helen,
Countess of Gifford, on one of his estates in Ireland. “The Greek Beauty”
is, of course, Helen of Troy, and the reference in the alternative heading is
apparently to that fine passage in the third book of the “Iliad,” where
Helen meets the Trojan chiefs at the Scæan Gate (see line 154, which
speaks of “Helen at the Tower”).</p>

<p class='c007'>On the last two lines, founded of course on the well-known passage in
Job (xxxviii. 4-7), compare Dante:</p>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Aloft the sun ascended with those stars</div>

<p class='c007'>There ought to be far more in a man than can be put into a front window.
This man had all sorts of “curios” in his shop window, but there was
nothing rich or rare in his soul; and so there was room for all of <i>him</i> in a
den which would not have held the hundredth part of his wares. The contemptible
manner of the man’s life is strikingly brought out by the various
suppositions (stanzas 5, 6, 7) so different from the poor reality (8-9). All
he cared for was business, which made him “chuckle” on the one hand or
“chafe” on the other, according as times were good or bad (10). Even in
his business it was not the real excellence of his wares he cared for, only
their saleability (11). A merchant prince is a very different person (13-19).
The last three stanzas give the lesson in a style partly humorous, but passing
in the end to an impressive solemnity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lesson of this beautiful fancy is the complement of the “Shop”
lesson. Even drudgery may be divine; since the will of God is the work
to be done, no matter whether under St. Peter’s dome or in the cell of the
craftsman (the Boy)—“all one, if on the earth or in the sun” (the Angel).</p>

<p class='c007'>The poem is so full of exquisite things, that only a few can be noted.
The value of the “little human praise” to God Himself (distich 12), all
the dearer because of the doubts and fears in it (20-22); and the contrast
between its seeming weakness and insignificance and its real importance as
a necessary part of the great chorus of creation (34); the eager desire of
Gabriel to anticipate the will of God, and his content to live on earth and
bend over a common trade, if only thus he can serve Him best (13-19);
and again the content of the “new pope Theocrite” to go back to his “cell
and poor employ” and fill out the measure of his day of service, growing
old at home, while Gabriel as contentedly takes his place as pope (probably
a harder trial than the more menial service) and waits for the time when
both “sought God side by side”—these are some of the fine and far
reaching thoughts which find simple and beautiful expression here.</p>

<p class='c007'>Longfellow’s “King Robert of Sicily,” though not really parallel, has
points of similarity to “The Boy and the Angel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Patriot, on his way to the scaffold, surrounded by a hooting crowd,
remembers how, just a year ago, the same people had been mad in
their enthusiasm for him. Anything at all, however extravagant, would
have been too little for them to do for him (stanza 2; cf. Gal. iv. 15, 16);
but now——! The fourth stanza is very powerful. All have gone who
can, to be ready to see the execution; only the “palsied few,” who cannot,
are at the windows to see him pass. In the last stanza the thought of a
more sudden contrast still is presented. A man may drop dead in the
midst of a triumph, to find that in its brief plaudits he has his reward,
while a vast account stands against him at the higher tribunal. Far better
die amid the execrations of men and find the contrast reversed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is “an old story,” and therefore general; but one naturally thinks of
such cases as Arnold of Brescia, or the tribune Rienzi. A higher Name
than these need not be introduced here, in proof of the people’s fickleness!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Instans Tyrannus,” the <i>present</i> tyrant, the tyrant for the time only, whose
apparently illimitable power to hurt shrivels into nothing in presence of the
King of kings, whose dominion is everlasting.</p>

<p class='c007'>The poor victim of this tyrant’s oppression is a true child of God, but the
nobility of his inner life is of course concealed from the proud wretch who
despises him, and who, it must be remembered, is the speaker throughout.
We must be careful, therefore, to estimate at their proper worth the epithets
he applies and the motives he attributes to the object of his hate. <i>He</i> can,
of course, think of no other reason why his victim “would not moan, would
not curse,” than that, if he did, “his lot might be worse.” And again,
when temptation failed to shake his steadfast patience, the tyrant is quite
consistent with himself, as one of those who call evil good, and good evil,
in speaking of him as still keeping “to his filth.” The last stanza is magnificent.
Has the power of prayer ever been set forth in nobler language?</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Lost Leader” is supposed to be the poet Wordsworth, who, on
accepting the laureateship, abandoned the party of distinguished literary
men who had enthusiastically supported the principles of the French
Revolution. It is necessary, of course, to enter into the lofty enthusiasm of
that party, and for the moment to identify ourselves with it, in order to
appreciate the wonderful power and pathos of this exquisite poem. (See
Wordsworth’s “French Revolution as it appeared to enthusiasts at its
commencement.”)</p>

<p class='c007'>The contrasts are very powerful between the one (paltry) gift he gained,
and all the others (love, loyalty, life, &amp;c.) they were privileged to <i>devote</i> (far
richer than mere possession); and again, between the niggardliness of his
new patrons with their dole of silver, contrasted with the enthusiastic
devotion of his own followers, who having nothing but “copper,” would
yet put it all at his service—having nothing but “rags,” were yet so liberal
with what they had, that had they been purple, he would have been proud
indeed, seeing that “a riband to stick in his coat” had proved so great an
attraction.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second stanza the fountains of the great deep of human feeling
are broken up. “Life’s night begins” suggests at once the strength
of the previous attachment, and the hopelessness of the broken tie being ever
knit again on earth. The best thing is to be counted enemies now, and fight
against each other as gallantly as they would have fought together. At the
same time there is absolute confidence in the ultimate triumph of the party of
freedom—he may “menace our hearts,” but we shall “master his”—and
in the ultimate recovery of the lost leader himself, whom he hopes to find
“pardoned in heaven, the first by the throne.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The supreme value of love is a constantly recurring thought in the poems
of our author. We shall meet it in its higher ranges in selections to come.
Here we are still in the sphere of the mere earthly affection, with only the
suggestion, in contrast with the transitoriness of earthly glory, of its indestructibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>No explanation seems needed, excepting perhaps to call attention to this,
that the “little turret” in stanza 4 is not a bartizan, but a staircase turret,
or it could not “mark the basement, whence a tower in ancient time sprang
sublime.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Observe, in each stanza, the striking contrast between the former and the
latter half, so balanced that the poem might be divided into fourteen single
or six double stanzas.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is not much of the descriptive in the poems of our author; he is
the poet, not of Nature, but of Human Nature; but when he does touch
landscape, as here, it is with the hand of a master.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following sentence, from Walter Besant, in “All Sorts and Conditions

great is the beauty of human nature, even in its second rate or third rate
productions, that love generally follows when one of the two, by confession
or unconscious self-betrayal, stands revealed to the other.”</p>

      <div class='line'>Go!—saying ever as thou dost proceed,</div>

      <div class='line'>A sunflower outspread like a sacrifice</div>
      <div class='line'>Before its idol. See! These inexpert</div>
      <div class='line'>And hurried fingers could not fail to hurt</div>
      <div class='line'>The woven picture; ’tis a woman’s skill</div>
      <div class='line'>Indeed; but nothing baffled me, so, ill</div>
      <div class='line'>Or well, the work is finished. Say, men feed</div>
      <div class='line'>On songs I sing, and therefore bask the bees</div>
      <div class='line'>On my flower’s breast as on a platform broad:</div>
      <div class='line'>But, as the flower’s concern is not for these</div>
      <div class='line'>But solely for the sun, so men applaud</div>
      <div class='line'>In vain this Rudel, he not looking here</div>
      <div class='line'>But to the East—the East! Go, say this, Pilgrim dear!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This poem was first published in “Bells and Pomegranates” under the
head of “Queen Worship.” How exquisite the plea of the unnoticed
Flower, with no pretence to vie with the Mountain in its claim upon the
Sun’s attention, except this, that the great unchanging Mountain is
“vainly favoured,” while the Flower yields itself up in ceaseless and self-forgetting
devotion to an imitation, however feeble and foolish, of the great
Sun Life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second stanza is very rich. There is no mention in it of Sun or
Mountain or Flower; but as the Flower looks up to the Sun from its nook
at the Mountain’s base, so Rudel yearns for “one gold look” from his Sun,
the “Angel of the East.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The meaning of the third stanza will be apparent when it is remembered
that “French Rudel” was a troubadour of the 12th century—the days of
the Crusades, and of the romance of chivalry. In those days the best way
to communicate with the East would be through some pilgrim passing
thither: and nothing would be more natural than such a reference to the
“device” which he had patiently, and in spite of difficulty, worked so as to
wear it as her “favour:” and once more, it is eminently natural to represent
the troubadour, not as sending a written message, but as finding a sympathetic
pilgrim to burden his memory with it—charging him to keep it fresh
by repetition till it had been duly delivered.</p>

      <div class='line'>In a dream that loved one’s face meets mine,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But the house is narrow, the place is bleak</div>
      <div class='line'>Where, outside, rain and wind combine</div>

<p class='c007'>This poem, published in “Jocoseria” in 1883, has no connection with
“Rudel,” published in “Bells and Pomegranates” in 1842; but it will
naturally follow it as “another of the same,” only with a happier ending;
for though we learn from history that poor Rudel did one day reach Tripoli,
it was only to die there,—let us hope still looking “to the East—the
East!”</p>

<p class='c007'>We get a glimpse here of the shifting moods of a lover’s soul. First, there
are the thoughts connected with the present experience—time and place all
that could be desired, but the loved one, absent, (lines 1-5); next, thoughts
arising from a dark dream or foreboding of the future when he and his loved
one shall meet, but under circumstances cruelly unpropitious, the house
narrow, the weather stormy, unsympathetic strangers by with furtive ears
and hostile eyes, and even malice in their hearts (6-11); and last, the man
within him rises to shake off the horrid serpent-like dream, and look forward
with a healthy hope that time and place and all will be well; or, if the house
must be narrow, (compare the Latin, “res angusta domi”) it will be a
Home, storms and strangers without, peace and rest within!</p>

<p class='c007'>This is still the love of earth; but dealt with so grandly, that it is no
wonder that some have understood it of the higher love, and to the question
of the first line would give the answer, “God.” Nor can it be said that the
thought is alien—rather is it close akin; for is not the earthly love, when
pure and true, an image of the heavenly? It would be well, indeed, if love
songs were oftener written in such a way as to suggest thoughts of the love
of Heaven. The Bible is especially fearless in its use of the one to illustrate
the other. With the higher thought in view, we are reminded of the closing
lines of “The Rhyme of the Duchess May,” by Mrs. Browning—</p>

<p class='c007'>This poem, so exquisite in finish, well-nigh perfect in form, is one of the
few works of our author, almost universally known and admired. It is
doubtful, however, if all its admirers look beneath the form and finish, or
understand much more of it than they do of other poems, the crabbed style
of which repels admiration as strongly as this attracts it. The tender pathos
of the “geranium leaf” in the first and last stanzas, touches a chord in every
heart; but <i>the</i> thought of the piece is something far deeper and stronger,
namely this, that true love is immortal, and that, therefore, however much
it may fail of its object here, or even (if possible) in lives that follow this, it
cannot fail for ever, it <i>must</i> find its object and be satisfied. It is a poem,
not of the pathos of death, but of the promise of Life!</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the proem to “La Saisiaz,” one of the most remarkable of the
poet’s works, in which the doctrine of immortality is argued with a profundity
of thought that has perhaps never been surpassed, even in language
freed from the fetters of verse. It also appears as No. III. of “Pisgah
Sights” in the second English series of selections. Both of these connections
suggest the key-note.</p>

<p class='c007'>Observe the progress in the thought. In the first stanza the soul is
“fretless and free”; in the second it moves onward and upward; in the
third it has reached the region of “Sunshine and Love, Sky-blue and
Spring!” Similarly as to the body—in the first stanza there is the apparent
victory of the grave, “dust to dust”; in the next comes the thought that,
after all, the body may only be slumbering; in the last, there is the
beautiful suggestion that it is only hiding where it is tenderly cared for,

<p class='c007'>These lines appeared first as the Epilogue to the second series of
Dramatic Idyls, published in 1880. In October of the same year, the poet

appeared (in fac-simile) in the <i>Century Magazine</i> of November, 1882.

<p class='c007'>The true poet is he who discovers and discloses, for man’s recognition
and enjoyment, the hidden beauties which abound everywhere in the great
kingdom of God. These beauties may be unrecognised at first, so that the
poet is not known as a poet, except to such as the speaker here is supposed
to be (“I know you”). He recognises in him a star. How is it, then, that
his light is hidden? The hand of God, who looks down on him from far
above (“God’s glow-worm”) as I look up to him from far below (“my
star”), has closed around him to keep him and his light safe till the time
shall come for discovery (Stanza 3) and for recognition (4). The drawing,
or simile follows, of a Tyrian fisherman (5), who brings from the great sea
the common-looking little whelk, from which, by a secret process, is
obtained that wonderful dye which out-dazzles art, and almost equals
Nature’s most exquisite tints (6-10). While the process is going on, the
world stands aloof (11); but as soon as the extract is “priced and saleable,”
the commonest people (12) can recognise it and make it pay (13);
while the man who fished it up remains poor and unknown to fame.</p>

<p class='c007'>The application is made with characteristic brevity, oddity, and antithetic
power: Nokes, Stokes, &amp; Co., gorging turtle; John Keats wanting
porridge!</p>

<p class='c007'>In connection with “Popularity” should be studied “The Two Poets of
Croisic,” far too long to be inserted here. An interesting comparison, also,
may be made with a little poem of Tennyson’s called “The Flower,”

<p class='c007'>“The Guardian Angel” is given as a slight specimen of an important
class, dealing with painting and painters. In the lovely poem, “One
Word More,” Browning disclaims all ability to paint; but no one could
have a more exquisite appreciation of the art.</p>

<p class='c007'>Has the tender pathos of these verses ever been surpassed? The calm
of heaven is in this thought spread out—translated into song. Let it
be read in connection with Spenser’s exquisite lines, beginning “And is
there care in heaven?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alfred, dear friend,” is Mr. Alfred Domett, who was then Prime
Minister of New Zealand, at which far end of the world the Wairoa rolls

<p class='c007'>This is a “gem of purest ray.” In order to understand it fully, it is
necessary to know that the “group by Woolner” is of two deaf and dumb
children—the one as if speaking, the other in the attitude of listening.
The speech denied passage through the lips, breaks out in rarer beauty
from the eyes; and for the hearing denied entrance by the ears, there is,
instead, a subtle responsiveness of brow and cheek to the spirit utterance
from the soul of the other; so that love, though “vexed,” is not suppressed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The exquisite beauty of the illustration of “the prism’s obstruction,”

</div>

<p class='c007'>Having given specimen poems dealing with the arts of poetry, painting,
and sculpture, we add one on the subject of music, which, though difficult
to understand fully, has beauties which are apparent even to those who do
not enter into its deepest thought. Vogler is not known as a composer of
the first rank, having left no works behind him which entitle him to a place
among the great masters; but, for this very reason, he is better suited for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the poet’s purpose, which is to deal with music, not as represented by printed
notes, but as existing for the moment in all its perfection, and at once
melting away into silence and apparent nothingness. It is as extemporizer,
not as author, he is chosen, and as Abbé (<i>Ger.</i> Abt) he appropriately thinks
of those deep spiritual truths on which the loftier hopes of the latter part of
the poem are founded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The musician “has been extemporizing,”—pouring out his whole soul
through the keys of his organ, and from that state of ecstasy he suddenly
awakes and cries out, “Would that the structure brave, the manifold music
I build ... might tarry!” It has been no mere “volume,” but a
“palace” of sound. As Solomon (according to the well-known legend)
summoned all spirits from above and from below, and all creatures of the
earth, to build him a palace at once, so by a touch, “calling the keys to
their work,” he has summoned demons of the bass, angels of the treble,
earth creatures of the middle tones, who, by eager and tumultuous and yet
harmoniously united efforts, have caused “the pinnacled glory” to “rush
into sight” (stanzas 1-3).</p>

<p class='c007'>Into sight? There was far more in it than could be seen. As the soul
of the musician ascended from earth, heaven descended on him; its stars
crowned his work; its moons, its suns were close beside him—“there was
no more near nor far” (4). And the boundaries of time, as well as the limits
of space, were gone. The <i>absolute</i>, the <i>perfect</i> was reached; and to this
palace of perfection had flocked “presences plain in the place,” from the
far Future and from the mystic Past. “There was no more sea”—no
more distance or separation—all one, together, perfect (5). Reached how?
Through music—the only one of the arts that leads into the region of the
absolute and perfect, its effects not springing from causes the operation of
which can be traced, and the law of their production defined, but responding
directly to the will, even as creation responded to the <i>fiat</i> of God. Out
of such simple elements can that be evoked, which should lead those who
“consider” these things to “bow the head” (6, 7).</p>

<p class='c007'>But was it only for a moment? Is it gone? Forever? (8).</p>

<p class='c007'>I turn to God, and know it cannot be. Then follows that glorious
passage, one of the finest in any language, every word of which should be
studied, beginning—“There shall never be one lost good!” on to the end
of stanza 11, which is the true climax of the poem.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last stanza may be compared to the closing one of “Saul.” It is the
return from the empyrean to the plain of common life. Let some musical
friend show how at the cadence of a very grand piece he would feel his way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>down the chromatic scale, and then pause on that poignant discord, known
as “the minor ninth,” effecting, as it were, a separation (“alien ground”)
from the heights just descended, and giving thus the opportunity of looking
up once more before a resting-place is found in “the common chord,”—“the
C major of this life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is a poem which should be read over and over till the music of it has
fairly entered the soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has become common now to speak slightingly of those representations
of heaven which make large use of music to give them body in our thought,
as if the idea intended to be conveyed were that the joy of heaven was to
consist in an endless idle singing, a concert without a finale; but this easy
criticism is surely too disregardful of the distinctive feature of music so
strikingly set forth in this poem—viz., that it is the only one of the arts
which while strongly appealing to sense, yet in its essence belongs to the
realm of the unseen, so that it is in fact the only symbol within the range of
man’s experience which can even suggest the absolute, the perfect, the pure
heavenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following passage, from the “Memorials of Frances Ridley Havergal,”
(p. 151) is so strikingly illustrative of “Abt Vogler,” that we cannot forbear
quoting it:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the train I had one of those curious musical visions which only very
rarely visit me. I hear strange and very beautiful chords, generally full,
slow and grand, succeeding each other in most interesting sequences. I do
not invent them, I could not; they pass before my mind, and I only listen.
Now and then my will seems aroused when I see ahead how some fine
resolution might follow, and I seem to <i>will</i> that certain chords should come,
and then they do come; but then my will seems suspended again, and they
go on quite independently. It is so interesting, the chords seem to <i>fold
over each other</i>, and die away down into music of infinite softness, and then
they <i>un</i>fold and open out, as if great curtains were being withdrawn one
after another, widening the view, till, with a gathering power and intensity
and fulness, it seems as if the very skies were being opened out before one,
and a sort of great blaze and glory of music, such as my outward ears never
heard, gradually swells out in perfectly sublime splendour. This time there
was an added feature; I seemed to hear depths and heights of sound
beyond the scale which human ears can receive, keen, far-up octaves, like
vividly twinkling <i>starlight</i> of music, and mighty slow vibrations of gigantic
strings going down into grand thunders of depths, octaves below anything
otherwise appreciable as musical notes. Then, all at once, it seemed as if
my soul had got a new sense, and I could <i>see</i> this inner music as well as
hear it; and then it was like gazing down into marvellous <i>abysses of sound</i>,
and up into dazzling regions of what, to the eye, would have been light and
colour, but to this new sense was <i>sound</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Men and Women,” a collection of fifty poems, first published in 1855,
is probably the best known of our author’s numerous volumes. Some of
the very finest of his work is in it. To this collection “One Word More”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>is an appendix, in the form of a dedication of the fifty poems to his wife,
Elizabeth Barrett Browning. As we learn from stanza 13, this work differs
from all others in having been dashed off, the first time of writing being
also the last time; and yet (such is the inspiration of love) it stands with
the very highest of his works. It needs careful reading, but presents no
such difficulties as “Abt Vogler.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rafael, painter for the world, becomes for once a poet for his dearest.
If only these wonderful sonnets could be found, how we should prize them;
but the volume is hopelessly lost (stanzas 2-4).</p>

<p class='c007'>Dante, poet for the world, prepares for once to paint an angel for <i>his</i>
dearest. But, alas! he is hindered by the breaking in of some “people of
importance” of the city, the sort of people who served as character models
for “the folk of his Inferno” (5-7).</p>

<p class='c007'>There would evidently be less of art and more of nature in such an outpouring
of soul; and, therefore, the true artist would long to do it “once,
and only once, and for one only.” “The man’s joy” would be found in
the mere utterance of his soul to his dearest, without any thought of art,
which, to the true artist, lifts so high an ideal that his shortcoming is
always a “sorrow” (8).</p>

<p class='c007'>So is it with the prophet, the exercise of whose high calling can never be
dissociated from its burdens and cares (9). If he dared, which he may not
(10), how gladly for the one that he loved would he “put off the prophet”
and provide water, not by the forth putting of power, but simply as the
man, through the self-denial of love (11).</p>

<p class='c007'>Browning himself has only the one art, so cannot leave his poetry to
paint, or carve, or “make music” (12); but as the nearest equivalent
possible to him will write “once, and only once, and for one only,” a
purely extemporaneous production (13), which shall not, like his other
works, be dramatic in principle, but spoken in his own “true person” (14).</p>

<p class='c007'>Then follows the wonderful moon illustration, so marvellously wrought
out, based upon the familiar astronomical fact that, through all her phases
and movements she always presents exactly the same face to the earth (15),
the other remaining entirely concealed (“unseen of herdsman, huntsman,
steersman,” &amp;c.), and therefore available as a new revelation (who knows of
what grandeur?) for the loved and specially-favoured mortal (16).</p>

<p class='c007'>The application of the illustration in stanzas 17 and 18 is exquisitely
beautiful, as is the gem-like quatrain with which the poem closes.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SAUL.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>[The three selections which fill up the rest of this little volume are given
as specimens of the distinctively Christian poems of our author. The first
gives us Christ in the Old Testament; the second, Christ in the New; the
third, Christianity in its essential truth and practical application. As only
a portion of “Saul” can be given, a few words will be necessary to prepare
the reader unacquainted with the whole for taking up the thread at the 14th
stanza, from which, in the selection, the poem is continued uninterruptedly
to the end.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Young David is telling over to himself (see “my voice to my heart,” in
stanza 14) the story of his mission to Saul, when, as an inspired poet-musician,
he charmed the evil spirit away from him. Stanza 16, consisting
of one line, is the hinge of the entire poem; for David has just reached
the point where, after several unsuccessful, or very partially successful,
attempts—first, by playing one and another and another tune, which might
awaken some chord in the apathetic spirit of the king, and then by singing,
accompanied by the harp, first, of the joy of life, then of the splendid
results of a royal life like Saul’s in the great future of the world—he at
last, the truth coming upon him, strikes the high key where full relief is
found. As he approaches this crisis in the tale, he cannot go on without
an earnest invocation for help to tell what he had been so wonderfully led
to sing:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Made a proffer of good to console him—he slowly resumed</div>

      <div class='line'>His black locks to their wonted composure, adjusted the swathes</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his turban, and see—the huge sweat that his countenance bathes,</div>
      <div class='line'>He wipes off with the robe; and he girds now his loins as of yore,</div>
      <div class='line'>And feels slow for the armlets of price, with the clasp set before.</div>
      <div class='line'>He is Saul, ye remember in glory,—ere error had bent</div>
      <div class='line'>The broad brow from the daily communion; and still, though much spent</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Be the life and the bearing that front you, the same, God did choose,</div>
      <div class='line'>To receive what a man may waste, desecrate, never quite lose.</div>
      <div class='line'>So sank he along by the tent-prop, still, stayed by the pile</div>
      <div class='line'>Of his armour and war-cloak and garments, he leaned there awhile,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sat out my singing,—one arm round the tent-prop, to raise</div>
      <div class='line'>His bent head, and the other hung slack—till I touched on the praise</div>
      <div class='line'>I foresaw from all men in all time, to the man patient there;</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus ended, the harp falling forward. Then first I was ’ware</div>
      <div class='line'>That he sat, as I say, with my head just above his vast knees</div>
      <div class='line'>Which were thrust out on each side around me, like oak roots which please</div>
      <div class='line'>To encircle a lamb when it slumbers. I looked up to know</div>
      <div class='line'>If the best I could do had brought solace: he spoke not, but slow</div>
      <div class='line'>Lifted up the hand slack at his side, till he laid it with care</div>
      <div class='line'>Soft and grave, but in mild settled will, on my brow: thro’ my hair</div>
      <div class='line'>The large fingers were pushed, and he bent back my head, with kind power—</div>
      <div class='line'>All my face back, intent to peruse it, as men do a flower.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus held he me there with his great eyes that scrutinized mine—</div>
      <div class='line'>And oh, all my heart how it loved him! but where was the sign?</div>
      <div class='line'>I yearned—“Could I help thee, my father, inventing a bliss,</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Stanza 14.</i>—Observe the meeting of the human and divine in the poet-prophet’s
inspiration. As poet, his powers were in their fullest exercise,
and still there was an unfathomable heaven of the unknown above him, till
“one lift of Thy hand cleared that distance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The close of this stanza sets before us the scene of the writing of this
reminiscence.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'><i>Stanza 15.</i>—The soothing influence of the singing begins to appear. Be
sure to keep in mind the picture, so wonderfully illustrated, of the attitude
of the two; and mark the words of David, “All my heart how it loved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>him,” connecting them carefully with the next stanza (16), “<i>Then</i> the truth
came upon me.” It is only to the earnestly-loving heart that such a revelation
of God could be given. “God is Love, and he that loveth not
knoweth not God.” Observe, also, in this short stanza the effect of the
intense earnestness of his soul, leading him to lay aside his harp and cease
his singing, and simply break out in impassioned speech.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'><i>Stanza 17.</i>—Shall God be infinitely above his creature man, in all
faculties except one, and that “the greatest of all,” viz., Love? (Note, in
passing, the exquisite beauty of the lines: “With that stoop of the soul
which in bending upraises it too,” and “As by each new obeisance in spirit,
I climb to his feet.” The passage immediately following this line is of
course ironical at his own expense, which is indicated by the parenthetical
“I laugh as I think”; as if to say “how utterly foolish the thought that
such a wide province, such a grand gift, as Love, should be mine quite
apart from God, the great Ruler and Giver of all!”)</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'><i>Stanza 18.</i>—Impossible! God is the giver: all that I have—Love, as
well as everything else—is from him; I can wish, but cannot will the
thing I would; but God can, therefore God will; his love cannot be
frustrated as mine is; it must even for such as “Saul, the failure, the ruin
he seems now,” find Salvation; being infinite it must have its will, and find
a way, however hard it be (see the striking line “it is by no breath,” &amp;c.);
and <i>there it is</i>! See <span class='sc'>the Christ</span> stand!</p>

<p class='c007'>Remember carefully the position as explained in the 15th stanza as
you read the magnificent climax, beginning—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>“O Saul, it shall be</div>
      <div class='line'>A Face like my face that receives thee;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>observe also the effect of the spondee with which stanza 18 closes, instead
of the usual anapæst; it gives wonderful dignity and strength to the
thought. The same effect is produced several times in the early part of the
poem by the same means, but nowhere with such power as in this, the
grand climax.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c007'>What a contrast here to the petty mechanical notions of inspiration
which have so often degraded the loftiest subject of human thought; and
how marvellously is the presence and the power of the Unseen on such a
soul as David’s imaged forth in the lines of the closing stanza, in words
which seem almost to utter the unutterable.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>This most interesting and beautiful poem will afford a good illustration of
one of the cases of difficulty referred to in the Introduction. The reader is
placed in the position of one who has just found this Arabian epistle, and
must decipher and interpret it without any extraneous aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>First comes, according to Eastern custom, the name (line 1), then the
address (7), with the greeting (15), and mention of articles sent with the
letter—all in true Eastern style—with such adjuncts as give a general idea of
the school of physiology and medicine to which the writer belongs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The twenty-first letter had ended at Jericho, and here, accordingly, the
twenty-second begins. The date appears as we read on, marked by the
expedition of Vespasian and his son Titus against Jerusalem. When
Bethany is mentioned, our interest is awakened, and we wonder what is
coming; but to the writer Bethany has no such associations, as is indicated
by the light and jocular way in which he marks its distance from Jerusalem,
and carelessly proceeds to record the observations it is his main business to
make wherever he goes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Further on, however, we discover that there is something of importance
weighing on his mind, which makes him hesitate and debate as to the trustworthiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of the messenger he intends to employ; while, at the same
time, he is evidently ashamed to tell his master what is troubling him. This
accounts for his abruptly ending his letter (determining, for the moment, to
say nothing about it); then, unable to refrain, beginning again, yet still
trying to conceal the depth of his feeling, and to apologize for what appears
in spite of himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>A long account of the case follows. By this time the reader has begun
to have a pretty good idea who “the man” is that “had something in the
look of him,” and knows that it is a veritable case of one raised from the
dead. But Karshish cannot, of course, except under strong compulsion,
be expected to take this view; and, accordingly, he begins by looking at it
in a strictly professional light—“’Tis but a case of mania,” &amp;c. He
naturally supposes that his master will set it down as an ordinary instance
of hallucination: “Such cases are diurnal, thou wilt cry.” Then he
mentions points which strike him as altogether peculiar, certain features of
the “after life” which are quite inconsistent with the idea of mania.
Instead of being the worse for his mania, this man is immeasurably the
better. Could Karshish and his master but penetrate the secret, what
physicians they would be! The scene when Lazarus is brought in by the
Elders of his tribe—who regard him as a madman, because he is living a
life so far above anything they can understand—is inimitable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the illustration of the beggar suddenly become rich, Karshish lets
out at last that he suspects there must be some truth in the man’s story.
His patient, he observes, now measures things with no earthly measure,
seeing often the small in the great and the great in the small; looking at
everything “with larger, other eyes than ours”; accepting with perfect
equanimity the very greatest <i>sorrow</i>, yet filled with alarm at the least
gesture or look which gives token of <i>sin</i>, because to him it was like
trifling with a match over a mine of Greek fire!</p>

<p class='c007'>In the next illustration, of the thread of life across an orb of glory, the
writer seems to get still fuller insight into the reality of the case—the little
thread being, of course, the poor life in Bethany, and the vast orb of glory,
the great eternity of God, in which Lazarus was consciously living. And
here, again, we have the same lesson as in “The Boy and the Angel.”
Though conscious of the glory of the great orb, Lazarus does not despise
the little duties belonging to the thread of his earthly life. He sedulously
follows his trade whereby he earns his daily bread; indeed, the special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>characteristic of the man is “prone submission to the Heavenly will.”
Mark the profound suggestiveness of the lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“He even seeketh not to please God more</div>
      <div class='line'>(Which meaneth, otherwise) than as God please.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He is so calm as to be provoking. At his inquisitor’s burst of indignation,
he shows no sign of anger or impatience—“He merely looked with his
large eyes on me.” And yet no apathy about him; a man full of loving
interest in all things. (Compare Coleridge’s well-known lines: “He
prayeth best who loveth best,” &amp;c.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The paragraph which follows introduces us to a region familiar and
sacred to us, but foreign and inexplicable to our physician, who refers to it
from his own point of view, stigmatizing the claim of “the Nazarene who
wrought this cure” as not only false, but monstrous; and yet—and yet—and
yet—he cannot get over it; it haunts him. But still he is ashamed
to acknowledge it, and so turns abruptly from what he affects to call
“trivial matters” to “things of price,” like “blue-flowering borage”!</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he gives another elaborate apology, and tries to account for the
hold the phenomenon has taken of him by a reference to his state of body
and surroundings when first he met this Lazarus; and, accordingly, professing
to care little whether the letter reaches or not, again he closes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet still he cannot rest. The great thought haunts him. “The very
God! <i>think</i>, Abib.” Then follows that consummate passage with which
this magnificent poem closes.</p>

<p class='c007'>After this “Epistle” should by all means be read “A Death in the
Desert,” too long and too difficult to be inserted here. The surprise
awaiting the reader of the parchment “supposed of Pamphylax the
Antiochene” will add to the interest of a poem so full of beauty and
power.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c014'>CHRISTMAS-EVE.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Between Christmas-Eve and Easter-Morn lies the earth history of the
Incarnate Son of God. Into the shadows of our world He came; and,
after a brief night amid its darkness, rose again into the light of heaven.
These titles then may well include the whole substance of Christianity.
Christmas suggests the thought of heaven come down to earth; Easter,
of earth raised up to heaven. “Christmas-Eve” leads naturally to the
contemplation of the Christian Faith; “Easter-Day,” to the contemplation
of the Christian Life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each poem turns on an impressive natural phenomenon which suggests
the blending of heaven and earth—the one, of the night, a lunar rainbow;
the other, of the dawn, the aurora borealis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The speaker (who is the same throughout the former poem) begins his
Christmas-Eve experiences with the flock assembling in “Zion Chapel,” a
congregation of rude, unlettered people, worshipping with heart and soul
indeed, but with little mind and less taste. It is not from choice that
he is there. It is a stormy night of wind and rain, from which he has
taken shelter in the “lath and plaster entry” of the little meeting house.</p>

      <div class='line'>One sheep more to the rest in fold,</div>

      <div class='line'>They eyed me much as some wild beast,</div>
      <div class='line'>That congregation, still arriving,</div>

      <div class='line'>Not a few suddenly emerging</div>

      <div class='line'>Where the road stops short with its safeguard border</div>
      <div class='line'>Of lamps, as tired of such disorder;—</div>
      <div class='line'>But the most turned in yet more abruptly</div>
      <div class='line'>From a certain squalid knot of alleys,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the town’s bad blood once slept corruptly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which now the little chapel rallies</div>
      <div class='line'>And leads into day again,—its priestliness</div>
      <div class='line'>Lending itself to hide their beastliness</div>
      <div class='line'>So cleverly (thanks in part to the mason),</div>
      <div class='line'>And putting so cheery a whitewashed face on</div>
      <div class='line'>Those neophytes too much in lack of it,</div>
      <div class='line'>That, where you cross the common as I did,</div>
      <div class='line'>And meet the party thus presided,</div>

      <div class='line'>They front you as little disconcerted</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the same light and humorous, half irreverent style, he proceeds to a
somewhat detailed description of the people and their uncouth worship—not
altogether a caricature, but evidently wanting in that sympathy with
the good at the heart of it, the thought of which was afterwards so strongly
borne in upon his soul. So, he “very soon had enough of it,” and gladly
“flung out of the little chapel” “into the fresh night air again.”</p>

      <div class='line'>Yet felt in my heart, amid all its sense</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the power, an equal evidence</div>
      <div class='line'>That his love, there too, was the nobler dower.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Then follows a long and rather abstruse passage, leading up to the following
lofty and inspiring conclusion:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So, gazing up, in my youth, at love</div>
      <div class='line'>As seen through power, ever above</div>
      <div class='line'>All modes which make it manifest,</div>
      <div class='line'>My soul brought all to a single test—</div>
      <div class='line'>That he, the Eternal First and Last,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who, in his power, had so surpassed</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>All man conceives of what is might,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose wisdom, too, showed infinite,</div>

      <div class='line'>Would never, (my soul understood,)</div>
      <div class='line'>With power to work all love desires,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bestow e’en less than man requires;</div>
      <div class='line'>That he who endlessly was teaching,</div>
      <div class='line'>Above my spirit’s utmost reaching,</div>
      <div class='line'>What love can do in the leaf or stone,</div>
      <div class='line'>(So that to master this alone,</div>
      <div class='line'>This done in the stone or leaf for me,</div>
      <div class='line'>I must go on learning endlessly)</div>
      <div class='line'>Would never need that I, in turn,</div>
      <div class='line'>Should point him out defect unheeded,</div>
      <div class='line'>And show that God had yet to learn</div>
      <div class='line'>What the meanest human creature needed,</div>
      <div class='line'>—Not life, to wit, for a few short years,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tracking his way through doubts and fears,</div>
      <div class='line'>While the stupid earth on which I stay</div>
      <div class='line'>Suffers no change, but passive adds</div>
      <div class='line'>Its myriad years to myriads,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though I, he gave it to, decay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seeing death come and choose about me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And my dearest ones depart without me.</div>
      <div class='line'>No: love which, on earth, amid all the shows of it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Has ever been seen the sole good of life in it,</div>
      <div class='line'>The love, ever growing there, spite of the strife in it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall arise, made perfect, from death’s repose of it.</div>
      <div class='line'>And I shall behold thee, face to face,</div>
      <div class='line'>O God, and in thy light retrace</div>
      <div class='line'>How in all I loved here, still wast thou!</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Whom pressing to, then, as I fain would now,</div>
      <div class='line'>I shall find as able to satiate</div>
      <div class='line'>The love, thy gift, as my spirit’s wonder</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou art able to quicken and sublimate,</div>
      <div class='line'>With this sky of thine, that I now walk under,</div>
      <div class='line'>And glory in thee for, as I gaze</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus, thus! Oh, let men keep their ways</div>
      <div class='line'>Of seeking thee in a narrow shrine—</div>
      <div class='line'>Be this my way! And this is mine!</div>

<p class='c007'>The lunar rainbow, so wonderfully described in the next stanza, is the
occasion and point of departure of the poetic vision or ecstasy which
occupies the remainder of the poem—</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>VI.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For lo, what think you? suddenly</div>
      <div class='line'>The rain and the wind ceased, and the sky</div>
      <div class='line'>Received at once the full fruition</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the moon’s consummate apparition.</div>
      <div class='line'>The black cloud-barricade was riven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ruined beneath her feet, and driven</div>
      <div class='line'>Deep in the West; while, bare and breathless,</div>
      <div class='line'>North and South and East lay ready</div>
      <div class='line'>For a glorious thing that, dauntless, deathless,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sprang across them and stood steady.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas a moon-rainbow, vast and perfect,</div>
      <div class='line'>From heaven to heaven extending, perfect</div>
      <div class='line'>As the mother-moon’s self, full in face.</div>
      <div class='line'>It rose, distinctly at the base</div>
      <div class='line'>With its seven proper colours chorded,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which still, in the rising, were compressed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until at last they coalesced,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>And supreme the spectral creature lorded</div>
      <div class='line'>In a triumph of whitest white,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Above which intervened the night.</div>
      <div class='line'>But above night too, like only the next,</div>
      <div class='line'>The second of a wondrous sequence,</div>
      <div class='line'>Reaching in rare and rarer frequence,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the heaven of heavens were circumflexed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Another rainbow rose, a mightier,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fainter, flushier and flightier,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Rapture dying along its verge.</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, whose foot shall I see emerge,</div>

<p class='c007'>He did see One emerging from the glory—</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>VIII.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All at once I looked up with terror.</div>
      <div class='line'>He was there,</div>
      <div class='line'>He himself with his human air,</div>
      <div class='line'>On the narrow pathway, just before.</div>
      <div class='line'>I saw the back of him, no more—</div>
      <div class='line'>He had left the chapel, then, as I.</div>
      <div class='line'>I forgot all about the sky.</div>
      <div class='line'>No face: only the sight</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a sweepy garment, vast and white,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a hem that I could recognise.</div>
      <div class='line'>I felt terror, no surprise;</div>
      <div class='line'>My mind filled with the cataract,</div>
      <div class='line'>At one bound of the mighty fact.</div>
      <div class='line'>“I remember, he did say</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Doubtless, that, to this world’s end,</div>
      <div class='line'>“Where two or three should meet and pray,</div>
      <div class='line'>“He would be in the midst, their friend;</div>
      <div class='line'>“Certainly he was there with them!”</div>
      <div class='line'>And my pulses leaped for joy</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the golden thought without alloy,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I saw his very vesture’s hem.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then rushed the blood black, cold and clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a fresh enhancing shiver of fear;</div>
      <div class='line'>And I hastened, cried out while I pressed</div>
      <div class='line'>To the salvation of the vest,</div>
      <div class='line'>“But not so, Lord! It cannot be</div>
      <div class='line'>“That thou, indeed, art leaving me—</div>
      <div class='line'>“Me, that have despised thy friends!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The confession of his sin in despising <i>His</i> friends in the little chapel is
speedily followed by a gracious token of forgiveness:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>IX.</div>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The whole face turned upon me full.</div>
      <div class='line'>And I spread myself beneath it,</div>
      <div class='line'>As when the bleacher spreads, to seethe it</div>
      <div class='line'>In the cleansing sun, his wool,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Steeps in the flood of noontide whiteness</div>
      <div class='line'>Some defiled, discoloured web—</div>
      <div class='line'>So lay I, saturate with brightness.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>His sin thus purged (how exquisitely wrought out the lovely simile of the
sun-cleansed wool!), he is “caught up in the whirl and drift of the
vesture’s amplitude,” and thus clinging to the garment’s hem, is carried
across land and sea—to a scene so complete a contrast to the one he has
just left that he is confused, and some time elapses before he discovers that
he is in front of St. Peter’s at Rome:—</p>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And so we crossed the world and stopped.</div>
      <div class='line'>For where am I, in city or plain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Since I am ’ware of the world again?</div>
      <div class='line'>And what is this that rises propped</div>
      <div class='line'>With pillars of prodigious girth?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is it really on the earth,</div>
      <div class='line'>This miraculous Dome of God?</div>
      <div class='line'>Has the angel’s measuring-rod</div>
      <div class='line'>Which numbered cubits, gem from gem,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twixt the gates of the New Jerusalem,</div>
      <div class='line'>Meted it out,—and what he meted,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have the sons of men completed?</div>
      <div class='line'>—Binding, ever as he bade,</div>
      <div class='line'>Columns in the colonnade</div>
      <div class='line'>With arms wide open to embrace</div>
      <div class='line'>The entry of the human race</div>
      <div class='line'>To the breast of ... what is it, yon building,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ablaze in front, all paint and gilding,</div>
      <div class='line'>With marble for brick, and stones of price</div>
      <div class='line'>For garniture of the edifice?</div>
      <div class='line'>Now I see; it is no dream;</div>
      <div class='line'>It stands there and it does not seem:</div>
      <div class='line'>For ever, in pictures, thus it looks,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus I have read of it in books</div>
      <div class='line'>Often in England, leagues away,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wondered how these fountains play,</div>
      <div class='line'>Growing up eternally</div>
      <div class='line'>Each to a musical water-tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whose blossoms drop, a glittering boon,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Before my eyes, in the light of the moon,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the granite layers underneath.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There follows a description of the worship in the great cathedral—not
now, as before, unsympathetic and merely critical, but giving evidence of
the liveliest appreciation of the feelings of the intelligent and devout
ritualist, as in the following passage:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Earth breaks up, time drops away,</div>
      <div class='line'>In flows heaven, with its new day</div>
      <div class='line'>Of endless life, when he who trod,</div>
      <div class='line'>Very man and very God,</div>
      <div class='line'>This earth in weakness, shame and pain,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dying the death whose signs remain</div>
      <div class='line'>Up yonder on the accursed tree,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall come again, no more to be</div>
      <div class='line'>Of captivity the thrall,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the one God, All in all,</div>
      <div class='line'>King of kings, Lord of lords,</div>
      <div class='line'>As his servant John received the words,</div>
      <div class='line'>“I died, and live for evermore!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Still he cannot enter into it. He is left outside the door. Distracted
with conflicting emotions, his reason repelled by the superstition, his spirit
attracted by the lofty devotion which he discovers at the heart of the too
gorgeous ritual—he cannot make up his mind whether he should join them
for the one reason, or shun them for the other—</p>

      <div class='line'>Able to mark where faith began</div>

<p class='c007'>The remainder of the stanza is taken up with a most eloquent, but somewhat
difficult passage, illustrating the triumph of the new Love over the
old Culture. In the following stanza he makes up his mind that he “will feast
his love, then depart elsewhere, that his intellect may find its share”; so
the next transition, by the same mode of rapture, is to a German University.
What he sees there provokes again his latent humour:—</p>

      <div class='line'>At home in England, to my knowledge.</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>On benches, waiting what’s to see there;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which, holding still by the vesture’s hem,</div>

      <div class='line'>All settle themselves, the while ascends</div>
      <div class='line'>By the creaking rail to the lecture-desk,</div>
      <div class='line'>Step by step, deliberate</div>

      <div class='line'>I felt at once as if there ran</div>
      <div class='line'>A shoot of love from my heart to the man—</div>
      <div class='line'>That sallow virgin-minded studious</div>
      <div class='line'>Martyr to mild enthusiasm,</div>
      <div class='line'>As he uttered a kind of cough-preludious</div>
      <div class='line'>That woke my sympathetic spasm,</div>
      <div class='line'>(Beside some spitting that made me sorry)</div>
      <div class='line'>And stood, surveying his auditory</div>
      <div class='line'>With a wan pure look, well nigh celestial,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Those blue eyes had survived so much!</div>
      <div class='line'>While, under the foot they could not smutch,</div>
      <div class='line'>Lay all the fleshly and the bestial.</div>
      <div class='line'>Over he bowed, and arranged his notes,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the auditory’s clearing of throats</div>
      <div class='line'>Was done with, died into a silence;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, when each glance was upward sent,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Each bearded mouth composed intent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a pin might be heard drop half a mile hence</div>
      <div class='line'>He pushed back higher his spectacles,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let the eyes stream out like lamps from cells,</div>
      <div class='line'>And giving his head of hair—a hake</div>
      <div class='line'>Of undressed tow, for colour and quantity—</div>
      <div class='line'>One rapid and impatient shake,</div>
      <div class='line'>(As our own young England adjusts a jaunty tie</div>

<p class='c007'>The stanza which follows gives an account of the discourse, which is a
learned discussion of “this Myth of Christ,” “which, when reason had
strained and abated it of foreign matter, left, for residuum, a man!—a
right true man,” but nothing more. He has no difficulty in determining
his duty here (“this time He would not bid me enter.”) The religious
atmosphere in which Papist and Dissenter live may be far from pure, in the
one case for one reason, and in the other for the opposite; but either of
the two is immeasurably better than the vacuum left when the Critic has
done his work of destruction. Then follows a long argument to show the
unreasonableness of denying the divinity of Christ, only a part of which
can be given here.</p>

stanzas 17-20, till once more he is caught up and carried back to his
original starting point. The remainder of the poem can now be given
without interruption, and will be readily understood. (The exquisite
development of the simile of the cup and the water will be specially noted,
as also the charitable wish so strikingly expressed on behalf of the poor
Professor, that before the end comes he may know Christ as “the God of
salvation.”)</p>

  <h3 class='c014'>EASTER-DAY.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>As Christmas-Eve has suggested the subject of the Christian Faith,
Easter-Day gives occasion to a discussion concerning the Christian Life—the
life of those who are “risen with Christ.” The poem is in substance a
conversation or discussion between two persons, one of whom (a thorough
Christian) finds it very hard, while the other (who takes a much lower and
more common-place view of spiritual things) thinks it quite easy, to be a
Christian. It is not, however, in the form of a conversation. As usual in
Browning’s work, one speaks, stating his own views and quoting the other’s,
which are therefore distinguished from his own (except when he quotes, as
he sometimes does, from himself) by quotation marks. The argument is
too abstruse to be followed out in all its ramifications; but enough of it
can be given to render quite intelligible the extracts from it which we find it
possible to give. The opening sentence will give the theme:—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>The stanza which follows gives the speaker’s answer, ending with this
striking passage:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>

      <div class='line'>“Renounce the world!”—Ah, were it done</div>

      <div class='line'>How easy were it!—how soon past,</div>
      <div class='line'>If once in the believing mood!</div>

<p class='c007'>To which the other replies by reproaching him for ingratitude to God,
who really asks us to give up nothing that is good, but only to observe such
moderation in our pleasures that life is all the more enjoyable, while sorrow
almost disappears, transfigured in the light of love. This answer has such
a ring of the true metal in it, that the speaker begins his rejoinder with the
question, “Do you say this, or I?” and then proceeds (in a passage of
wonderful power) to expose the superficiality of the view he is endeavouring
to support.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then follows the Sentence, excluding him from the heaven of spirit, and
leaving him to the world of sense, hopeless for ever of anything higher—a
sentence which seemed to him at first to be rather a reward than a punishment,
as he thought of “earth’s resources—vast exhaustless beauty, endless
change of wonder!” Even a fern-leaf a museum in itself!</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer of the Voice to this shallow thought leads us into the very
loftiest regions of the imagination, suggesting views of the future of the
redeemed which make the soul thrill with eager expectancy—</p>

<p class='c007'>At this answer “sharp despairs shot through” him, at the thought of
what he had missed; but on reflection he finds comfort in the prospect of the
possibilities of Art. Again the inexorable voice is heard, pronouncing loss
unspeakable. Even if he could be a Michelangelo (Buonarroti), it would
be only the initial earthly stage of his development that was possible for
him. (The whole passage is magnificent; but perhaps the exquisitely
wrought-out illustration of the lizard in its narrow rock-chamber will be
most enjoyed.)</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
